# Galaxy Classification Algorithms - An IAYC 2017 Project

--------------------------------------------

## Classification of galaxies using machine learning methods:

Machine Learning (ML) involves statistical methods that mimic learning processes. In recent
years, it has been proven to be an interesting approach to prediction problems that involve vast
amounts of data. The aim of this project is to classify large sets of pictures of galaxies into
three different categories using ML algorithms.
